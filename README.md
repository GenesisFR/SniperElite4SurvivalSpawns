# Sniper Elite 4 Survival Spawns

In this document, you'll find all sniper/vehicle spawns and enemy count per wave in every single survival map of Sniper Elite 4 on the Authentic Plus difficulty. I don't know if lower difficulties have the same spawns and I won't cover those.

Please note that "solo" was done through a multiplayer lobby, not by selecting "Single Player -> Solo Survival" (which has different spawns that won't be covered here).
