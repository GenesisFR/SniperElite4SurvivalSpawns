# Sniper Elite 4 Survival Spawns

In this document, you'll find all sniper/vehicle spawns and enemy count per wave in every single survival map of Sniper Elite 4.

Please note that "solo" was done through a multiplayer lobby, not by selecting "Single Player -> Solo Survival" (which has different spawns that won't be covered here).

You'll find red circles when looking at screenshots. Snipers periodically move between them after reaching their sniping spot.

> [!CAUTION]
**Valkyrie snipers can one shot you on Authentic Plus!**
