# Sniper Elite 4 Survival Spawns

In this document, you'll find all sniper/vehicle spawns and enemy count per wave in every single survival map of Sniper Elite 4.

You'll find red circles when looking at screenshots. Snipers periodically cycle between them after reaching their sniping spot.

Please note that "solo" was done through a multiplayer lobby, not by selecting "Single Player -> Solo Survival" (which has different spawns that won't be covered here).
